===================================================
Deprecation: #NaN - Deprecate translation functions
===================================================

See :issue:``

Description
===========

The functions "translate" and "createTranslation" seems to be a leftover from an earlier version of cal. In the frontend is no option to create any translation, in the backend you can rely on the core functions.


Impact
======

None.


Migration
=========

None. Use the TYPO3 own functions.

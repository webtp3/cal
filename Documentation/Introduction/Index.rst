|img-5| **Important:** As of January 2019 we are in the process to overhaul the
complete extension in order to make it compatible with recent and
upcoming TYPO3 versions. It would be wise to assume, that this
documentation is outdated.

It is very likely that we missed existing features during our "make
the extension work with TYPO 9 LTS approach". Please help us to improve
the extension as well as the documentation.

If you find a mismatch between functions described within this document
and the extension itself, please check, if there is an coresponding
issue already created at https://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-cal/.
If that is the case, please enrich the ticket with all additional information
you gathered. If you are unable to find a matching issue, please create
a new one to let us know.
